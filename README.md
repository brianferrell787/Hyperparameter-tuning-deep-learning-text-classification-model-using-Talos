# Hyperparameter-tuning-deep-learning-text-classification-model-using-Talos
Talos is made for data scientists and data engineers that want to remain in complete control of their Keras models, but are tired of mindless parameter hopping and confusing optimization solutions that add complexity instead of reducing it. Within minutes, without learning any new syntax, Talos allows you to configure, perform, and evaluate hyperparameter optimization experiments that yield state-of-the-art results across a wide range of prediction tasks. Talos provides the simplest and yet most powerful available method for hyperparameter optimization with Keras.
